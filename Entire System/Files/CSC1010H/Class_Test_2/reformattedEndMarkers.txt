Consider the following problem. Answer it appropriately.

The Petersens have recently moved to a new town and are arranging a surprise birthday
party for their son Andre, and have invited three families from the neighbourhood, the Smiths,
the Januarys and the Hectors. They plan to make up party packets for the kids to take home
after the party, blue for boys and pink for girls.

Being super organised, Mrs Petersen with the help of Mr Petersen wants to determine how
many of each colour party packet she needs to buy, and also how many of each colour she
needs to put aside for each family.

They sit down and come up with the following information. Mrs Petersen remembers that the
Hectors have a "pigeon pair", i.e. a boy and a girl. Mr Petersen recalls that the Januarys
only have a set of identical twin boys. Mrs Petersen notes that she's only ever noticed two
girls from these local families to come over to play. Mr Petersen notes that the Smiths have
three children, since the family fits nicely into their family sedan when they go out.

You happen to be visiting the Petersens at this point, and want to impress them with the
problem solving skills you've learnt at university. Using the information they've provided,
determine how many of each colour party packet they need to buy and how many of each
colour they need to allocate to each family and what the total number of party packets are.

Use a diagram to show how you solve the problem.      [5]

Answer the following questions:

a) When using debugging features in an IDE, what should the user typically do once
execution has reached the breakpoint?       [2]

<split_marker>

Step over each line in program #1

Watches variables #1     
<split_marker>

b) When a new module has been defined, how do you ensure that it is accessible and can be
imported into a program with no problems, i.e. "import newmodule" works?  [1]

<split_marker>

Save it in same file #1 or   Save it in Python\Lib directory #1

Indicate whether the following statements are True or False.

d) The accepted Python coding convention for module names is long descriptive names in
uppercase.           [1]

Write a Python function called draw_line() which draws a line of horizontal line of characters.
The draw_line() function should take two parameters, with the first being the size of the line
(i.e. the number of characters) and the second parameter being the character with which to
draw the line. This character parameter should have a default value of an asterisk ('*').

Calling the draw_line() function with the following parameters should produce the
corresponding output:

draw_line(5)   produces   *****
draw_line(6,'$')      $$$$$$ [6]

<split_marker>

def draw_line(size,char='*'): #2
for i in range(size): #1
print(char,end='') #2
print() #1    or  print(char * size) #4

Consider the following recursive function definition:

def do_this(stuff):
if len(stuff) == 0:
return ""
else:
return str(stuff[0] * 2) + do_this(stuff[1:])

a) What datatype can the parameter to this function be?     [2]

<split_marker>

List, string #2

Or sequence #2       
<split_marker>

b) What is the base case for this function?       [1]

<split_marker>

Empty list/string/sequence #1      
<split_marker>

c)   Based on the do_this() function definition, what will the following statements display?

i. print(do_this([1,2,3]))       [2]

<split_marker>

246 #2       
<split_marker>

ii. print(do_this("123"))       [2]

def main():
f = open('to_do_list.txt','a')
while True:
thing_to_do = input('Enter thing to do:')
if thing_to_do == 'done': break
else:
f.write(thing_to_do + '\n')
f.close()

main()

<split_marker>

c)  Looking at the code, how does the user terminate the program?    [1]

<split_marker>

<split_marker>

d)  How will the information that the user enters be written in the file?    [1]

<split_marker>

Consider the following definition of the classify_weight() function. Specify test cases which
thoroughly test the function, using equivalence classes and boundary value. For each test case
specify whether it is an equivalence class value or a boundary value.

# classifies weight in kgs
def classify_weight(w):
if 0 < w <= 60:
return "light"
elif 60 < w <= 120:
return "heavy"
else:
return "error"
[6]

<split_marker>

any value between 0 and 60 - equivalence class value #1
any value between 60 and 120 - equivalence class value #1
any value not between 0 and 120 - equivalence class value #1
0 - boundary value #1
60 - boundary value #1
120 - boundary value #1
